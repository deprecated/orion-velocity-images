* The low-velocity structure
** Inner ring of low sigma
+ This wraps entirely round the Trapezium
  + sigma as low as 10/2.3 for [O III] (but remember, instrumental and thermal sigma have been removed)
  + Seen as a green ring in the 3-color map, with the central part being redder
  + Tempting to interpret as a half-shell, but need to bear in mind that the red bay has been shown to be quite thick along the line of sight
  + Could still be evidence of wind interaction
* Mapping the high-velocity flows in Orion
+ This is something we should do
+ Science goals
  + Plot the origins of the jets
  + Relation with the dark arcs and dark filaments
+ Data to use
  + SPM2013 [O III] data for Orion S [[file:~/Dropbox/SPMFEB13/OrionS/DOH-ha-cube.fits]]
  + Orion Atlas material
    + Moment maps and velocity channels and longslit spectra
  + John Meaburn & Robert Massey data from Trapezium region
    + Massey:1995a
    + Massey:1993a
    + They see a lot of the jets, and there are miny faint knots that maybe aren't picked up in the KPNO data
  + MUSE data
    + Not good velocity resolution, but good spatial resolution and systematics are different from slits
    + Some useful maps in [[file:~/Dropbox/orion-widths/data/]]
+ [ ] Plan of action
  + First thing, make ds9 regions of all the knots that we can find
  + Similar to what we did for the Alba project :(
+ Some possibly new discoveries
  + Red-shifted flows in Orion S
  + These are very weak
  + Diffuse feature at +120 km/s centered on 147-355
    + Very near origin point of HH529 corkscrew jet
    + Could be the counterflow
  + Jet from HST3
    + Surely this must have previous studies
  + Back-extension of HH203/204 jet
    + In the Orion Atlas sigma maps, this can be traced back all the way to a region that overlaps the HH529 bow
